### Slack installation instructions


1. Check your email for an invitation to join our workshop slack group!  The email will come from "feedback@slack.com" with the subject "pgalante has invited you to work with them in Slack".

2. Click on the link "Join Now" and enter your name and a password, then click "create account". Now you can see the Slack channel from any web browser.  If you prefer, you can also download the Slack app (https://slack.com/) and see the channel from there, but you do NOT need to install the software in order to see the slack channel.

3. Once you have created an account, anytime you want to join the workshop slack channel again, paste this url into any web browser: wallacebiomod-mqt5901.slack.com
and sign in. <br> You should also get an email confirming that you created your account.
