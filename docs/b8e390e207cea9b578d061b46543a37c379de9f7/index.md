### Forms
**Participants**<br>
We would like to get to know everybody attending our workshop, but unfortunately we are not able to meet in person this year. Instead, we ask that every participant creates a single slide for the shared Google Slides document linked below, to introduce yourself to other participants. We look forward to getting to know everybody digitally.<br>

**Testing subgroups**<br>
Please use this form to tell us your preference for your software testing subgroup assignments. We will do our best to assign subgroups following participant preferences, but will adjust to ensure even numbers of participants across groups.<br>

### Resources

#### Data and subgroup instructions
##### Instructions for subgroup notetakers
If you are the assigned notetaker for your group, please take notes using whatever software you prefer (word, textfile, etc.), then save the document, and attach the file to the Slack channel #breakoutgroups by clicking the paperclip icon, navigate to the file, and click send. 

Although you can use the software of your choice, we suggest using the zoom "whiteboard" feature to take notes collaboratively with others in your group - see [this video](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/breakout-sessions/how-to-use-a-whiteboard-in-a-breakout-room/) for instructions on how to use the whiteboard function and then save the whiteboard image to your computer.
