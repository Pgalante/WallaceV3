## maskRangeR in Wallace Subgroup 

[Video: maskRangeR demonstration in Wallace](https://youtu.be/uBbYqQLRirU)

**Instructions for maskRangeR in Wallace**<br>
1. In R studio, run these lines of code: 
```{r}
library(wallace) 
run_wallace(biomodelos=TRUE) 
```
2. Wallace will open in your browser. Upload occurrence data in **Occ Data** module. 

Select "User-specified". 

Upload Occurrence CSV: *All_new_records_by_year.csv* 

Note: if you want to use the maskranger temporal extract module, this csv must include a column "year" with the years for occurrence data. Years should match MODIS data that you will upload in that module.  

3. Upload SDM. 

You can either work through Wallace to build a model, or choose the **User SDM** component. 

Find the Bassaricyon_neblina.tif file that you downloaded - it is inside the olinguito.zip zipfile.  

Upload distribution map (**): "Bassaricyon_neblina.tif" 

*Note: This is a continuous model prediction for the olinguito. All of the Mask modules can be done with a continuous model prediction, but note that some changeranger functions (area calculations) will require a thresholded model, so you may want to mask a thresholded  model here instead, to use later with changeranger. Make sure any model you upload in User SDM is projected and has the same name as the scientific name of your species occurrence csv file . 

4. In **Mask** component, select "Mask by Shapefile".  

Upload polygon in shapefile (.shp, .shx, .dbf): Load the SA_Ecoregions_WWF shapefile. 

This is WWF's Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World 

**NOTE**: You must upload *all three* files (.shp, .shx, .dbf) 

Click "Load".  

You may see an error message- don't worry. Wallace is giving you a warning: 

```{r}
! WARNING:Bassaricyon neblina cloglog | Projection not found for shapefile. It is assume that shapefile datum is WGS84 (**) 
```

Select Field: ECO_NAME 

First, deselect all. We will select the 5 options for "montane forest". 

**NOTE**: Blue sections will be removed, yellow will be kept. 

Select Attribute:

  - Cauca Valley montane forest 
  - Magdalena Valley montane forest
  - Eastern Cordilla real montane forests
  - Cordilla Oriental montane forest
  - Northwestern Andean montane forests 

Click Mask. It may take a minute. 

You can then download your masked projection, continue masking, or move on to ChangeRangeR. 

Lets try another Mask module 

5. In **Mask** component, select "Expert Polygon".  

Draw polygon using the polygon drawing tool. 

Click "Create". 

Select "remove polygon" and then "Mask". 

Note: You can only remove a polygon from a continuous model prediction. You can add or remove a polygon to a thresholded model prediction.  

Lets try the last Mask module 

6. In **Mask** component, select "Temporal Extract".  

Upload environmental rasters for masking distribution: Select the 5 MODIS files: 

   - 2005_olinguito_Modis.tif
   - 2006_olinguito_Modis.tif
   - 2008_olinguito_Modis.tif
   - 2009_olinguito_Modis.tif
   - 2010_olinguito_Modis.tif 

Click load. 

Select bounds by choosing **2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010**, and deselecting the rest of the  

years. Select only the years for which you have MODIS data and occurrence record data. 

Click "Get Bounds". 

Select raster for masking. 

Select upper and lower bounds. 

Click "mask". 

You can download the masked sdm or move on to changeRangeR.
